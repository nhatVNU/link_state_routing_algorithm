# Link State Routing Algorithm 
The Simulation of Link-State Routing Protocol is a part of the project under course EE3019 - Data Communications and Networking. The program accepts the network topology details in terms of the cost of links, and provides the shortest path tree for the network. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to construct its routing table.

This program has written by using C & Python.h 

## Input of program

Input is a adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix for undirected graphs is **always symmetric** and **Identity**

Adjacency atrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be matrix[ ][ ], a slot matrix[ i ][ j ] not equal to 0 indicates the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j, otherwise, matrix[ i ][ j ] = 0, do not have any edge from vertex i to vertex j

For example:

    4
    0  4  2  4
    4  0  2  0 
    2  2  0  2
    4  0  2  0

    7 0 9 8 5 6 0 9 2
    1 9 0 4 1 3 4 8 9
    2 8 4 0 2 2 4 4 6
    2 5 1 2 0 7 4 8 9
    8 6 3 2 7 0 2 0 0
    7 0 4 4 4 2 0 2 4
    1 9 8 4 8 0 2 0 8
    1 2 9 6 9 0 4 8 0

## How to build program

### Build directly
Build in linux:

    gcc src/*.c  -o build/output -I./include -I/usr/include/python3.8 -L/usr/lib/python3.8/config-3.8-x86_64-linux-gnu -lpython3.8

Build in window:

    gcc src/*.c -o build/output -I C:Python310\include -L C:Python310\libs -lpython310

Run output object in Linux/Window:

    ./build/output


### Build using Makefile
Build:

    make

Run:

    make run

Clear output file:

    make clean
