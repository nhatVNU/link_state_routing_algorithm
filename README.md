# link_state_routing_algorithm
The Simulation of Link-State Routing Protocol is a part of the project under course EE3019 - Data Communications and Networking. The program accepts the network topology details in terms of the cost of links, and provides the shortest path tree for the network. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to construct its routing table.
